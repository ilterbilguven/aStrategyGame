Hi,

I started with 2017.2b4 but, I faced with too many crashes/bugs. I insisted on but, I dealt with Unity itself rather that solving the problems. It consumed my time a lot. I couldn't meet some of the requirements.
Now it is based on 2017.0.1p2


Move Soldier:
Left Click to select.
Right Click to move it.


Known Issues:
- Units are spawned bottom-right corner of the building. It can move but, not automatically. If already there is a unit, it may duplicate.
- Design patterns are poorly implemented. First I tried to solve it before optimize it, but solution took a lot of time than expected.
- Aspect ratio is 16:9, and the grid is 32*27
