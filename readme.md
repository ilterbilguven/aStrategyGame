Hi,

I started with 2017.2b4 but, I faced with too many crashes that blocked me to continue, I switched to 2017.1f1, but got some problems.

Known Issues:
- Units spawns bottom-right corner of the object. It can move but, not automatically. If already there is a unit, it may duplicate.
- Design patterns are poorly implemented. First I tried to solve it before optimize it, but solution took a lot of time than expected.
- When "barracks" is selected, right corner there is information section. Normally, there is soldier production button, but Unity may not show. While playing, if I add a new button in the content, Soldier button immediately shows itself.
- Aspect ratio is 16:9, and the grid is 32*57
